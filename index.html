				<p>I am an engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and a masters student at the
					University of Virginia. I currently work as a software developer. Previously I was an electronics
					manufacturing engineer in the assembly of electronic spaceflight hardware. I am currently pursuing
					my master of electrical engineering. This site provides information about me and examples of my
					work. In particular, this site includes several projects I've built
					(see <a href='./projects.html'>Projects</a>) and some literature and presentations I've authored
					(see <a href='./literature.html'>Literature</a>).
