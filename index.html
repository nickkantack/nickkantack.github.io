				<p>I am an electrical engineer and software developer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.
					I work on applications of AI for human-machine teaming and medical diagnosis. I also perform
					electrical design and rapid-prototyping for climate science related applications and have worked
					on several projects pioneering new uses of augmented and virtual reality. On my own time, I enjoy
					building AI agents to excel at board games, video games with mechanics built around real world
					phenomena, and writing and arranging music.
