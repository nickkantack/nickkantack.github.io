My website

Hello.

This repository holds the source files for my personal
website. It contains the source code for various simulations
mainly powered by a suite of scripts which together 
power convincing 3D graphics and animations.

Since I wrote these scripts to power my website, at
the moment I am providing no additional instructions on how
to use them. However, each script is thoroughly commented
to make its use as easy as possible. You are free to 
examine and/or copy any of the source code in this repository.
If you are interested in using any of the scripts in this
repository, I recommend you start with the webpage that
most closely accomplishes what you intend to make it do.
Check the imported scripts of that page to get an idea of
what interdependencies the scripts have. Study how the page
makes use of the desired scripts and implement a similar
style into your project.
