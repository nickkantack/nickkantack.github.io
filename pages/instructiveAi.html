            <p>
                Instructive artificial intelligence (AI) is an method I'm exploring as an alternative to explainable AI.
                Instructive AI aims to provide insight into AI decision making in the form of corrections on human decision making.
                This idea is already <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01726">published</a> in connection with preliminary
                experiments we've performed in the context of the card game <a href="hanabi.html">Hanabi</a>.
            </p>

            <div class="sectionSubtitle">Is this not just another approach to explainable AI (XAI)?</div>

            <p>
                No, it is distinct from XAI. Specifically, XAI techniques focus on describing a decision making process
                (usually that of an AI). Instructive AI techniques focus on describing differences between decision making
                processes (usually between an AI and a human). Consequently, AI instructions will be insufficient to understand
                an AI's decision making, but are instead meant to be combined with an existing decision making process
                (for instance, how a human approaches a problem) to gain insight into the important differences between
                the AI and the human.
