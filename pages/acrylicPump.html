				<div class="sectionTitle">Designing an (almost) fully acrylic pump</div>

				<p>
					In the spring of 2020 as Covid-19 was rapidly spreading across the globe, APL set aside some research
					dollars and issued a series of challenges to staff to help provide clever engineering to help the nation
					respond to the emerging healthcare crisis. One effort was to come up with cheap and mass-produceable
					ways to build emergency ventilators. I participated in an effort to explore whether acrylic pneumatics
					could serve as a viable emergency stopgap in lieu of better equipment. While our effort ultimately did
					not produce a viable low cost ventilator, I was able to make some pretty cool mechanical systems made
					entirely out of laser cut acrylic (even down to laser cut, snap-together axles).
				</p>

				<p>
					The pump is designed to be built out of components all cut from a single quarter inch acrylic sheet.
					No connective hardware is needed (screws, bolts, etc.). Instead, the pump is designed with snap fits
					between all of the pieces so that it can be assembled without any tools needed. The axles for the
					gears are made by snapping together two pi shaped pieces.
