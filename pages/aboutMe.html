            IntriCon had some winding machines that were built in the 70s
            and had controllers that were aging but which could no longer be replaced with newer
            versions. In my first week of work I accidentally corrupted the software of the last
            spare controller we had. I told my boss that I was 80% confident I could build a 
            modern replacement for the controllers in the span of a week. Thus, I spent my entire
            second week of work poring over the internal workings of the winders, mapping their
            circuits, probing voltages during their operation, and designing a replacement
            controller built on an Atmega chip. At the end of the second week, I had successfully
            built a cheap and reliable replacement controller. I really enjoyed learning
            how to work with microcontrollers and the challenge of reverse engineering an old
            and complex machine. This was the first of several projects in automation and machine
            control that I got to build entirely from scratch.

            IntriCon had a process for recording daily production numbers from each machine
            operator that consisted of the operator filling out a paper form with their totals
            for the day. Later, a shift manager would manually enter these totals into an excel
            spreadsheet. In this I saw an opportunity for automation that I could not pass up.
            I build a web application that ran locally on the company's internal network which
            allowed any operator to load a form and enter their production totals for the day
            (it was simply a digital version of the original paper form). The data were 
            curated on the server and shift managers could trade their data entry time for using
            a sweet of analytic tools I built into the system. Managers could view trends in 
            different metrics, compare data across shifts and operators. There was even an anomaly
            detection tool that would automatically send an email report that identified any
            dramatic changes in data that might need manager investigation. This was my first
            experience with building a data analytics web application and I enjoyed the challenge
            of creating intuitive ways for users to get the insights they're looking for in 
            their data.

                I was raised in South Dakota and obtained a bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics
                from the University of Oklahoma and a Masters degree from in Electrical Engineering
                from the Univeristy of Virginia. My career began at IntriCon, a medical device
                manufacturer in St Paul, MN. There I designed millimeter-scale electromagnetic coils
                for use in implantable medical devices. I also developed simulations mostly around
                the electrical performance of coils and data analytics software for driving 
                manufacturing process improvements. Two of my most proud moments were

                In 2018 I moved to Maryland and began working as an electrical engineer for the 
                <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory</a>. 
                Initially, I worked in the spaceflight hardware assembly group (you can even find my name
                listed <a href="https://dart.jhuapl.edu/Team/">here</a> among others who help build the
                spacecraft for NASA's <a href="https://dart.jhuapl.edu/">DART mission</a>). In early 2019
                I changed groups and began working as a software developer and artificial intelligence 
                researcher for the lab. My favorite projects there included authoring and coding a

            <p>
                I currently work as a level 2 software development engineer for Amazon Web Services. Specifically,
                I work as a backend engineer supporting two of the microservices that make up
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/connect/">Amazon Connect</a>, AWS's software-as-a-service solution
                for costumer service contact centers. My team maintains and developes features for a Lambda and a 
                Fargate web service primarily focused on ensuring connectivity and low latency between clients and
                our backend services. At Amazon I've learned how to bulid services from the ground up using AWS 
                infrastructure and core services. I also developed a quantile-based anomaly detection algorithm and
                authored several anomaly detection tools that are now used by multiple teams within AWS to identify
                changes in service performance that are often missed by traditional, band-based anomaly detection
                techniques. I've also developed a Javascript library that enables automation of various DevOps tasks
                like dynamically measuring the capacity of a web service against a hypothetical traffic load. I'm 
                also enjoying the opportunity to bring my machine learning experience to internal efforts to add
                intelligence to Amazon Connect.

                Presently in my career, I'm aggressively learning as much as I can about modern tools and frameworks for 
                hosting web services. I'm passionate about applying disciplined mathematics to tackle hard problems in 
                administering computationally complex services as efficiently as possible. Most recently, I'm exploring
                how machine learning models and computationally heavy workloads (e.g. predictions by large language models)
                can be pushed to the edge (e.g. web clients) and orchestrated via peer-to-peer communication to 
                prevent central service scaling and cost from being a bottleneck to serving data-driven content.
