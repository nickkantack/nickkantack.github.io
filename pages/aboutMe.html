            <p>
                I was raised in South Dakota and obtained a bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics
                from the University of Oklahoma and a Masters degree from in Electrical Engineering
                from the Univeristy of Virginia. My career began at IntriCon, a medical device
                manufacturer in St Paul, MN. There I designed millimeter-scale electromagnetic coils
                for use in implantable medical devices. I also developed simulations mostly around
                the electrical performance of coils and data analytics software for driving 
                manufacturing process improvements. One of my most proud moments was
                <span id="reverseEngineerSpan" class="popupStorySpan">reverse engineering an old winding machine controller</span>.
                and <span id="productionTrackingSoftwareSpan" class="popupStorySpan">writing production data tracking software from scratch</span>.
