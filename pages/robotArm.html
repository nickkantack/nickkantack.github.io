						APL held a hackathon in summer 2019 challenging staff to build something impressive using an
						Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Teams were given one week to build devices that would be judged by local
						public school students visiting APL. I chose to build a robotic arm that would mimic the motions
						of my own arm. The arm consisted of three joints powered by servomotors, a shoulder, an elbow,
						and a grip. The main structural components of the arm were designed in
						<a href="tinkercad.com">tinkercad</a> and laser cut out of acrylic. Some complex components were
						3D printed. The controlling interface was three potentiometers attached to my shoulder, elbow,
						and index finger which conveyed their resistances values over bluetooth to the receiver that
						drove the arm.
					</p>
					<p>
						The purpose of this hackathon was to entertain visiting high school students and to get them excited
						about STEM and the possibilities of what they can do with a little bit of hardware and a lot of
						imagination.
						Five teams competed in the Hackathon, and I was lucky enough to be selected the winner by the panel
						of judges.
