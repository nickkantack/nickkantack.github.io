            I am a software developer and electrical engineer with a background in device physics,
            artificial intelligence and machine learning, and software for embedded devices, web
            services, and data analytics. I enjoy combining statistical techniques and machine 
            learning with modern software tools and best practices to automate complex tasks. 
            I currently work as a software development engineer at Amazon Web Services.
            This website is designed to showcase 
            <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> of mine and provide easy access to my past
            work.
