            I am an electrical engineer and software developer at the
            <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory</a>.
            My work involves research into explainable artificial intelligence, human-machine teaming,
            and small scale device physics and simulation. I enjoy applying disciplined mathematics
            and statistics to develop effective models that can learn insights from problems spaces and share
            those insights in clear, useful ways.
        </p>

            At APL, I've been awarded $315,000 in grant funding across six projects that I've led (or am leading).
            These research projects are primarily focused on techniques for explainable artificial intelligence, human
            machine teaming,
            extracting insights from opaque, intelligent systems, as well as machine learning techniques for training,
            generalization, and adversarial attacks.

            On my own time, I enjoy building AI agents to excel at board games, tutoring,
            and writing and arranging music.
