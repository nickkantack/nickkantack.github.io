                    I enjoy writing and playing music. Piano is my forte, but I can also crank out a tune on saxophone,
                    violin, trumpet, and accordion. I've played keyboard in a few (nameless) jazz combos and the
                    University of Oklahoma's jazz band. Most recently, I've gotten a lot of fun out of arranging classic
                    songs in very different styles.

                    Most of my piano skill is concentrated in classical piano. I enjoy playing pieces from my
                    favorite composers (mainly Chopin and Liszt). Here is a video of me playing the beginning
                    of Fantasie Impromptu by Chopin.

                    For fun I took Edvard Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King" and arranged it as a swing and funk.
                    Here is a video of the best performance of it I could muster.

                    <a href="../mp3/Boomer_Impressions.mp3">Impressions of "Boomer Sooner"</a> - When I was in the Pride
                    of Oklahoma marching band in college, I had to play the OU fight song countless times. My friends and
                    I got tired of the standard rendition, so we enjoyed putting stylistic spins on the simple tune.
                    Here's a recording of me playing some of my favorite arrangements of Boomer Sooner.

                    <a href="../mp3/something.mp3">"Something" (Big band jazz)</a> - I've always like big band jazz and have
                    would love to spend more time learning how to write big band pieces. I've only ever dabbled, and the
                    results have been mixed. Here's a short start to a piece I wrote (using MuseScore) a while ago. Naming pieces is always
                    the lowest priority for me, so when I was saving this project and had to give it a name, I just put
                    down "something."
