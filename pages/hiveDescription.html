                    The Challenge of Developing a Hive AI
                </div>
                <p>
                    Hive is a unique, dynamic, and complex game. Since discovering the game in 2020, I became very interested
                    and strongly suspected that it was possible to make an AI that would outperform most humans.
                    In searching for an existing, strong Hive AI, I discovered that a handful of Hive agent's have been
                    built (e.g. <a href="http://tdk.bme.hu/VIK/DownloadPaper/Mely-megerositeses-tanulas-alapu-Hive-jatekos">a student paper</a>,
                    <a href="https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/files/project-library/cs5099/cmm40-Final_report.pdf">a graduate thesis</a>,
                    and an <a href="https://github.com/shaw3257/hive">open source project</a>),
                    yet none seemed to achieve strong play strength (namely, the ability to consistently beat humans).
                    I set out to try my hand at building a Hive agent that could, ideally, outperform any human opponent.
                    I've already gotten my AI to the level of outperforming myself, but I'm actively developing it to
                    try to achieve even stronger play.

                <div class="sectionSubtitle">Why is building a good Hive AI so challenging?</div>
                <p>
                    One major challenge with developing a Hive agent is calculating the list of possible moves. In a game
                    like chess or Go, calculating a list of all currently legal moves is straightforward and computationally
                    cheap. The mechanics of piece motion in Hive and the evolution of the game board over time causes
                    the delineation of possible moves to be computationally more intensive. To be clear, developing algorithms
                    that determine legal moves in Hive can be done methodically, but making these algorithms <i>fast</i>
                    so as to allow deeper AI evaluation is much more difficult. For instance, the "one Hive" rule stipulates
                    that the only pieces that can move are those which are not currently critical to keeping all played
                    tiles as one connected group. In short, if removing a piece would cut the hive into to completely
                    disjoint groups, then that piece cannot move. Unfortunately, whether a piece is mobile according to this
                    rule can change on each move, even moves that concern very far away pieces. Thus far, a majority of my
                    development effort has involved developing, refining, and accelerating these algorithms to minimize their
                    computational footprint and allow deeper tree searches to discover stronger moves.
