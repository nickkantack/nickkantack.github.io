                    The Challenge of Developing a Hive AI
                </div>
                <p>
                    Hive is a unique, dynamic, and complex game. Since discovering the game in 2020, I became very interested
                    and strongly suspected that it was possible to make an AI that would outperform most humans.
                    In searching for an existing, strong Hive AI, I discovered that a handful of Hive agent's have been
                    built (e.g. <a href="http://tdk.bme.hu/VIK/DownloadPaper/Mely-megerositeses-tanulas-alapu-Hive-jatekos">a student paper</a>,
                    <a href="https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/files/project-library/cs5099/cmm40-Final_report.pdf">a graduate thesis</a>,
                    and an <a href="https://github.com/shaw3257/hive">open source project</a>),
                    yet none seemed to achieve strong play strength (namely, the ability to consistently beat humans).
                    I set out to try my hand at building a Hive agent that could, ideally, outperform any human opponent.
                    I've already gotten my AI to the level of outperforming myself, but I'm actively developing it to
                    try to achieve even stronger play.
                </p>
                <div class="sectionSubtitle">Why is building a good Hive AI so challenging?</div>
                <p>
                    Hive has a relatively large branching factor (in the mid game, an average of about 70 according to
                    experiments with my AI). One of the main reasons for so many legal moves is that a player can have
                    a dozen hexes available to spawn new pieces and up to 8 types of pieces that could spawn in each
                    (\(12 \times 8 =96\) legal spawns, with alternative moves available). By comparison, Go has at most
                    361 legal moves (at the opening, when black can play in any of the \(19 \times 19 = 361\) points).
                    Imagine if Go had 8 different types of stones a player could play. More initial moves
                    would be available even if the board were only 7 points long (\(7 \times 7 \times 8 = 392\)).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compounding the branching factor is that determine which moves are legal requires much more computation
                    for Hive than it does for other games. In Go, any open point is a legal move provided it satisfies
                    Ko and is not a self-capture. For Hive, whether a piece can move involves first checking if the piece
                    is structurally critical to the hive (moving it does not separate the hive), and that there is enough
                    space for it to move. The former requires a consideration of the entire board, and the latter requires
                    a recursive search of the local hive perimeter.

                    I'm actively developing this site, and unfortunately I haven't yet had the time to complete this page.
                    If you're interested, I'll hopefully have this content finished by the end of October 2021.
